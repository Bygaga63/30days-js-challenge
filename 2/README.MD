# JS and CSS Clock

New things that I've learned:

After adding transform, you can change it position by transform-origin:

```css
{
    transform: rotate(90deg);
    transform-origin: 100%
}
```

Google Chrome devtools has transition-timing-function generator, then you can just copy paste it:
```css
{
    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0, 2.27);
}
```
